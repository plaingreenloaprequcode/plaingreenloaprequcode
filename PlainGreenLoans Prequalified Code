If you’re looking for a personal loan, the best option may be to apply with a financial institution like a bank or a credit union. A reputable financial institution often offers low interest rates, low fees, and flexible repayment options. You can typically apply online or in person if the bank has branch locations.

However, the smallest loan you can apply for at many lenders will likely be about $1,000 or more, and you’ll need a minimum credit score to qualify. Minimum credit scores will vary by lender.1

After you apply for a personal loan, a lender assesses your credit risk to determine if you qualify for the loan. They will consider your credit score, income, and other financial factors. If you’re approved, you receive the money in a lump sum and repay it over time plus interest in monthly payments.
